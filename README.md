# Employee-Performance-and-Retention-Analysis
This project aims to develop an Employee Performance and Retention Analysis using a real-world dataset. The goal is to apply concepts from probability, statistics, machine learning, and deep learning to analyze employee data and predict performance and retention trends.
ðŸ“‘ Detailed Project Report: Employee Performance and Retention Analysis
This report summarizes the findings, model performance, and recommendations derived from the analysis of the provided employee dataset, covering all phases of the project.

1. Phase I: Data Analysis and Statistical Insights
1.1 Data Preprocessing and Descriptive Statistics
The dataset contains 100 records and 8 features.

Data Quality: The dataset was clean, with no missing values (.isna().sum() was 0) and no duplicate rows (.duplicated().sum() was 0).

Descriptive Statistics:

Average Age: The mean age is 36.57 years with a low standard deviation (std=8.32), indicating a relatively young to mid-career workforce.

Average Tenure: The mean tenure (YearsAtCompany) is 10.8 years (std=6.36).

Performance Score: The scores range from 70 to 95 with an average of 84.94 (std=6.35). The manual binning classified the scores into four categories: Low (30), Medium (20), High (26), and Very High (24).

1.2 Correlation and Outlier Analysis (EDA)
Correlation (Heatmap): The heatmap revealed a few strong relationships:

PerformanceScore is highly correlated with Salary (r=0.87).

YearsAtCompany is highly correlated with Age (r=0.95).

Outlier Check (Boxplots): The boxplots indicated no significant outliers in Age, YearsAtCompany, or PerformanceScore. A few minor high-end points were visible in Salary, but these were retained as they likely represent valid high-income roles.

1.3 Probability and Hypothesis Testing
Overall Attrition:

P(Attrition = Yes): 39% (39 out of 100 employees left). This represents a very high baseline turnover rate for the organization.

Departmental Attrition: The risk of leaving varies significantly:

Sales: 53.85% (Highest Risk)

Engineering: 42.86%

HR: 34.62%

Marketing: 20.00% (Lowest Risk)

Bayes' Theorem Application (P(S | Attrition)):

The analysis calculated the conditional probability of an employee belonging to a specific Performance Category given that they left (Attrition = Yes).

Key Finding: Employees in the Very High Performance category accounted for the largest share of leavers (30.77% of all attrition), followed by the High category (28.21%).

Direct Attrition Rate by Performance: The probability of leaving is 50% for the Very High category, indicating that top performers are leaving at the highest rate.

ANOVA Hypothesis Testing (Performance Score vs. Department):

H 
0
â€‹
 : The mean PerformanceScore is the same across all departments.

Result: The p-value was extremely low (2.56Ã—10 
âˆ’12
 ), which is far below the 0.05 significance level.

Conclusion: Reject H 
0
â€‹
 . There is significant evidence that the mean PerformanceScore differs across departments. Performance is not uniform across the organization.

2. Phase II & III: Predictive Modeling and Evaluation
Numerical features were scaled using MinMaxScaler, and categorical features (Department, Attrition, PerformanceCategory) were transformed using LabelEncoder.

2.1 Employee Attrition Prediction (Classification)
This phase compared traditional ML (Random Forest, Logistic Regression) and Deep Learning (Neural Network) models.

Model	Accuracy	Precision (Yes=1)	Recall (Yes=1)	F1-Score (Yes=1)
Random Forest	0.7000	0.5714	0.5714	0.5714
Logistic Regression	0.6500	0.5000	0.4286	0.4615
Neural Network (DL)	0.7000	0.5556	0.7143	0.6250

Evaluation Details:

Best Overall Model: The Neural Network achieved the best F1-Score and the highest Recall.

Recall is Critical: The NN's high Recall (0.7143) means it correctly identifies 71.4% of the employees who will actually leave (minimizing False Negatives, which are costly errors).

Performance vs. LR: Both Random Forest and the Neural Network significantly outperformed Logistic Regression, suggesting the prediction task benefits from non-linear modeling.

2.2 Employee Performance Prediction (Regression)
This phase compared Linear Regression (ML) and a Feedforward Neural Network (DL) to predict the PerformanceScore.

Model	R-squared (R 
2
 )	Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Linear Regression (ML)	0.7737	0.0185
Feedforward NN (DL)	0.0491	0.0777

Export to Sheets

Evaluation Details:

Best Model: Linear Regression was the superior model, explaining 77.37% of the variance in the Performance Score.

DL Performance: The Neural Network for regression performed poorly (R 
2
 â‰ˆ0.05). This may be due to an insufficient or unstable network architecture for this specific task.

Top Predictors (Linear Model Coefficients):

Salary: 0.814 (Strongest positive influence on Performance Score).

YearsAtCompany: 0.011 (Very low positive influence).

Age: âˆ’0.004 (Very low negative influence).

3. Phase IV: Final Insights and Actionable Recommendations
Key Findings Summary
Top Performer Attrition Crisis: Employees in the Very High Performance category have the highest attrition rate (50%). The organization is failing to retain its most valuable talent.

Attrition Hotspot: The Sales department has the highest turnover probability (53.85%).

Performance Inequity: Performance is statistically unequal across departments (ANOVA rejection), requiring localized solutions.

Performance Driver: Salary is the overwhelming predictor of Performance Score (râ‰ˆ0.87 and a high linear regression coefficient).

Actionable Recommendations
Area of Focus	Detailed Strategy	Data-Driven Justification
High-Value Retention	Urgent "Top Talent" Intervention: Immediately interview all Very High Performing employees to understand dissatisfaction factors. Implement instant bonus/promotion adjustments, as they are the highest-risk group (50% attrition rate).	Bayes' Theorem showed top performers are leaving at an alarming rate.
Departmental Focus	Sales Department Task Force: Launch a deep retention and culture survey within the Sales department, as it has the highest single turnover risk (53.85%).	Conditional Probability clearly flags Sales as the primary "hotspot."
Compensation Policy	Direct Tie Between Salary and Performance: The R 
2
  score of 0.77 and high Salary coefficient (0.814) in the regression model indicate that performance is heavily dependent on compensation. Ensure all top performers are paid competitively and immediately address any perceived pay inequity.	Linear Regression metrics validate that Salary is the primary lever for performance.
Predictive System	Implement the Neural Network Attrition Model: Use the DL model (F1: 0.625, Recall: 0.714) to flag at-risk employees for immediate intervention, focusing on minimizing costly False Negatives (missed leavers).	The Neural Network offers the best balance of identifying true leavers (Recall) and overall prediction quality (F1).
